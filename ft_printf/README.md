# ft_printf

This project was completed as part of my curriculum at 42 School. The goal is to recreate the `printf` function from the C standard library. The `printf` function is used to print formatted data to the standard output.

## Description

The `ft_printf` function must support several format specifiers, such as `%s` for strings, `%d` for signed integers, `%c` for characters, and more. The project aims to develop a deep understanding of string formatting in C.

## Features

- Handling of format specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`.
- Handling of format flags such as field width and precision.
- Handling special characters such as `%%` to print the percent sign.
- Returning the total number of characters written.

## Usage

1. Compile the library:
```bash
  make
```

Then use the `ft_printf` function in your code as needed.
